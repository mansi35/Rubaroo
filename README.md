## Introducing childhood to second innings :)  

### Problem solved
Loneliness is the feeling of not 'being connected' and lack of affection in current relationships. Elderly in old age homes and children in orphanages look for companionship. The elderly may not be able to visit children due to restricted mobility or chronic illnesses among other reasons. The children also have little to no means of connecting with the elderly. Our web app comes to their rescue. Using technology, we have created this virtual space for them to connect and chat with each other, create in-app video calls, share stories, play games, read books and share the joy of learning and building relationships.


### Inspiration
As we all know, humans are social animals. Socialising and building relationships plays a major role in one's happiness. "Just one tenth of India’s seniors are not concerned about loneliness. 36 percent of those surveyed identified social interaction as their top priority in day-to-day life." While thinking about potential solutions to pertinent problems in the society, we realised that we need to device ways to take care of the mental health of the elderly and children. We decided to create this virtual platform which will help eradicate the logistical problems that a physical meet poses and also help keep the elderly and children safe during the ongoing pandemic.


## Technologies: 
• React - The front end of the web app was made using React js
• Symbl.ai - We use speech to text to convene conversations between people
• Firebase - Used for backend and database

Github Repo: https://github.com/mansi35/Rubaroo

Video Demo: 

Future Scope: 
• We intend to integrate the watch party feature backend wherein upto 4 members could watch movies/videos together.
• We also intend to include a screen share feature in the video call option
